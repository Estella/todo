Things that Hyperboria needs, if you have the time to help.

* Documentation
  - [our documentation](https://github.com/hyperboria/docs) needs some simplification. Most specifically, we want to make it easier for beginners to get started.
* Service Lists
  - We have a very basic and incomplete [service list](https://github.com/hyperboria/services). It needs automated testing to make sure those services are up.
* Onboarding
  - applications that make it easier to set up a cjdns node would be very helpful. https://peers.fc00.io makes it possible to search for public peers by continent, but users still have to insert those credentials into their configuration file.
* Public peer hosting
  - If you can offer a server with good bandwidth and a public, static IP, we would greatly appreciate it.
  - simply add your peer's credentials to http://github.com/hyperboria/peers
